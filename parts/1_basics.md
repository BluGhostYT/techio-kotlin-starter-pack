In this section you'll find some basics syntax to start coding with Kotlin.

#### Variables
Kotlin provides two way to declare variable.

- Immutable (read-only) variable:

Using the keyword `val`means that your variable could be assign just once.

>immediate assignment
``` kotlin
val a: Int = 1  
```
>variable's type is inferred
``` kotlin
val b = 2 // `Int`
```
>deferred assignment
``` kotlin
val c: Int  // type is required when there is no initializer
c = 3
```

- Mutable (read/write) variable:

``` kotlin
var x = 5 // `Int` type is inferred
x += 1 // x now is equals to 6
```

#### String templates


#### Control expressions



#### Loops
