This playground is an overview of Kotlin language features. I'll introduce syntax for starters and 
explain the basics, and what makes Kotlin a language that deserve your attention. 

I'll describe the following features as clearly as possible:

- Basics
  - Variables
  - String templates
  - Control expressions
  - Loops
- Classes
- Functions
  - High-Orders functions
  - Lambdas
  - Inline functions
- Collections
- Ranges
- Null safety
- Type Checks and Smart Casts
- Operator overloading
- Java interoperability 

For all this parts you'll find some explanation, flat code and nice interactive examples, that will 
show how Kotlin is a friendly companion to play with. 

> This documentation  is born from the desire to share some knowledge about Kotlin and the 
benefit to use a nice platform as tech.io.

> If you really want to get further with Kotlin I suggest you to read the book Kotlin In Action.

> NB: This Playground is wildly inspired by the [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang
.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html)
