In this playground, we'll cover some basics features from the Kotlin language. 

- Functions
- Variables
- String templates
- Control expressions
- Loops
- Ranges
- Collections
- Null safety

For all this parts we'll find some interactive examples that make Kotlin a friendly companion to play with. 

The idea is born from the desire to share some knowledge about Kotlin and the wish to use a nice platform as tech.io.

NB: This Playground is wildly inspired by the [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html)
